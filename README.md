## Project Overview

SpeakScape analyzes TED Talk transcripts to identify linguistic patterns associated with audience engagement. The platform extracts features like sentence complexity, pronoun usage, and rhetorical devices, correlating them with engagement metrics to provide personalized feedback for presentations.

## Technologies & Libraries
The following tools and libraries were used throughout the development of the SpeakScape platform:

- **Python** – Core programming language for data handling and NLP tasks  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – For exploratory data analysis and model experimentation  
- **Streamlit** – Used to build the interactive user interface  
- **Pandas** – For data cleaning, transformation, and feature preparation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – For generating statistical visualizations  
- **Scikit-learn** – Used in feature engineering and statistical modeling  
- **SpaCy** – Applied for tokenization and part-of-speech tagging  
- **NLTK** – Used for rhetorical device detection and text parsing  
- **JSON/CSV** – Format of source and processed TED Talk datasets
- **TXT/PDF** - Format of input and output data on streamlit

## Project Directory Structure

The project follows this directory structure:


## Running the Streamlit App

After processing the data and training models, you can run the Streamlit application:

```bash
# Navigate to the app directory
cd speakscape_appw

# Run the Streamlit app
streamlit run SPEAKSCAPE.py
```

## Deploying the Streamlit App

Instructions for deployment will be added in a future update.
